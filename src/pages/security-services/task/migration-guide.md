# Migration Guide: Supabase to PostgreSQL

This guide outlines the key changes made to migrate the Task Management Application from direct Supabase client calls to using a backend API with PostgreSQL.

## 1. Overview of Changes

The primary change was to replace direct Supabase client calls in frontend components with API calls through a dedicated task service. This service communicates with the existing backend API endpoints provided in the Express.js server.

## 2. Key Components Added/Modified

### 2.1 Backend Changes

- **Added New Controller Methods**: Added support for new features like reactions, auto-return, and service-specific data management
- **Extended Routes**: Updated routes to support all required functionalities
- **Database Migration**: Created a migration script to add a `comment_reactions` table and additional columns for tracking request assignments

### 2.2 Frontend Changes

- **Task Service**: Created a comprehensive service layer to handle all API calls
- **Updated Components**: Modified all components to use the task service instead of direct database calls
- **Hook Improvements**: Enhanced hooks for better data handling and error management

## 3. Implementation Details

### 3.1 Database Changes

- Added `comment_reactions` table with foreign keys to `request_comments` and `users`
- Added `last_assigned_to` column to `service_requests` table to track previous assignments

### 3.2 API Changes

- Implemented controllers and routes for all operations previously handled by Supabase
- Added proper transaction handling for multi-step operations
- Enhanced error handling and logging

### 3.3 Frontend Changes

- Replaced all Supabase client operations with API calls
- Enhanced state management for better UX
- Improved error handling and feedback

## 4. Files Created/Modified

### 4.1 New Files

- `task-service.js`: API service layer for all request operations
- `comment-reactions-migration.js`: Database migration script

### 4.2 Modified Files

- `RequestDialog.jsx`: Updated to use task service for CRUD operations
- `SendBackDialog.jsx`: Updated to use task service
- `UnableToHandleDialog.jsx`: Updated to use task service
- `useRequestComments.jsx`: Enhanced to use task service
- `useRequests.jsx`: Enhanced to use task service
- `EditDialog.jsx`: Updated to use task service
- `task-routes.js`: Extended with new routes
- `task-controller.js`: Added new controller methods

## 5. How to Run the Migration

1. Run the migration script to add the new database tables and columns:
   ```bash
   node server/migrations/comment-reactions.js
   ```

2. Update your backend server code with the new controller methods and routes

3. Replace the frontend components with the updated versions

4. Test all features thoroughly, especially transactions that involve multiple operations

## 6. Next Steps & Recommendations

1. **API Improvements**:
   - Add request validation using a library like Joi or Zod
   - Implement proper pagination in list endpoints
   - Consider adding caching for frequently accessed data

2. **Security Enhancements**:
   - Implement CSRF protection
   - Use HTTP-only cookies for authentication
   - Add rate limiting for sensitive endpoints

3. **UX Improvements**:
   - Consider implementing WebSockets for real-time updates
   - Add better offline support
   - Implement more robust error handling and recovery

4. **Testing**:
   - Add unit tests for all API endpoints
   - Add integration tests for complex workflows
   - Consider adding end-to-end tests with Cypress

5. **Performance**:
   - Optimize database queries with proper indexes
   - Consider implementing query caching
   - Profile and optimize slow endpoints

## 7. Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues during migration:

1. Check for any database schema inconsistencies
2. Verify all required environment variables are set
3. Ensure proper error handling in all API endpoints
4. Monitor database performance for slow queries
5. Check browser console for client-side errors

## 8. Conclusion

This migration provides a more robust, maintainable architecture by:

1. Separating concerns between frontend and backend
2. Providing a cleaner API abstraction
3. Leveraging the power of PostgreSQL for complex queries
4. Enabling better security practices
5. Setting the foundation for future scaling
