# Security Service System Design Document

## 1. High-Level Design (HLD)

### 1.1 System Overview

The Security Service System is a comprehensive platform designed to handle various security-related service requests for a telecommunications company in Rwanda. The system facilitates the management of services such as call history requests, mobile money transaction inquiries, device verification, and other security-related operations.

### 1.2 Architecture

The system follows a three-tier architecture:

1. **Frontend Tier**: Client-side application with user interfaces for submitting and managing service requests
2. **Backend Tier**: Server-side application handling business logic, authentication, and data processing
3. **Database Tier**: PostgreSQL database for persistent storage

### 1.3 System Components

- **Request Tracking**: Unique reference numbers and status tracking for all requests
- **Caching Strategy**: Optimized performance through strategic caching of frequently accessed data
- **Security Measures**: Password policies, activity logging, and session management
- **Workflow Management**: Structured processes for request handling and approval

## 2. Low-Level Design (LLD)

### 2.1 Database Schema

#### 2.1.1 Core System Tables

**Users Table**

#### 2.1.2 Service Request Tables

**Service Requests**
- Central table for all request types
- Stores common request attributes and metadata
- Links to service-specific tables via foreign keys

**Request Comments**
- Tracks communication around service requests
- Supports internal notes and customer communications

**Request History**
- Maintains complete history of request status changes
- Records who made changes and when

**Queue Handlers**
- Maps service types to authorized handlers
- Facilitates workflow management and task assignment

#### 2.1.3 Service-Specific Tables

**Each service type has a dedicated table:**
- Serial Number Requests
- Stolen Phone Checks
- Call History Requests
- Mobile Money Transaction Requests
- Mobile Money Unblock Requests
- Money Refund Requests
- Backoffice Appointments
- Unblock Call Requests
- Other Requests

### 2.2 API Endpoints

#### 2.2.1 Core Service Endpoints

```
GET /security-services
GET /security-services/permissions/:userId
GET /security-services/backoffice-users
```

#### 2.2.2 Service Request Endpoints

```
POST /security-services/serial-number-request
POST /security-services/stolen-phone-check
POST /security-services/call-history-request
POST /security-services/unblock-call-request
POST /security-services/unblock-momo-request
POST /security-services/money-refund-request
POST /security-services/momo-transaction-request
POST /security-services/backoffice-appointments
POST /security-services/other-request
```

### 2.3 Client-Side Implementation

The client-side service module (`security-service.js`) implements:

1. **Caching Mechanism**
   - In-memory cache for service and permission data
   - Configurable TTL (Time-To-Live) of 5 minutes
   - Manual cache invalidation capability

2. **Service API Interface**
   - Methods for retrieving available services
   - Methods for checking user permissions
   - Service-specific request submission methods

3. **Error Handling**
   - Consistent error response format
   - Detailed error logging
   - Client-friendly error messages

4. **User Context Integration**
   - Session-based user identification
   - Automatic user ID inclusion in requests

### 2.4 Server-Side Implementation

The server-side controller (`security-controller.js`) implements:

1. **Request Processing**
   - Validation of incoming request data
   - Reference number generation with year-based prefixes
   - Transaction management with rollback capability

2. **Database Operations**
   - ACID-compliant transaction handling
   - Optimized query performance
   - Proper error handling and logging

3. **Multi-table Operations**
   - Coordinated inserts across related tables
   - Proper foreign key relationships
   - Data integrity enforcement

### 2.5 Database Initialization

The database initialization script (`db-init.js`) handles:

1. **Schema Management**
   - Table creation with proper constraints
   - Index creation for performance optimization
   - Foreign key relationships

2. **Security Features**
   - Password management triggers and functions
   - Activity logging capabilities
   - Audit trail mechanisms

3. **Performance Optimization**
   - Strategic index placement
   - Query optimization structures
   - Efficient data access patterns

## 3. Workflows

### 3.1 Service Request Workflow

1. **Request Initiation**
   - User selects a service type based on permissions
   - System presents appropriate request form
   - User completes form with required details

2. **Request Submission**
   - Client validates form data
   - Request is submitted to the appropriate API endpoint
   - Server validates request and generates reference number

3. **Request Processing**
   - Request is recorded in the database
   - Service-specific details are stored in dedicated tables
   - Request is assigned to appropriate handlers

4. **Request Tracking**
   - Users can track request status via reference number
   - Status updates trigger notifications based on settings
   - Request history records all changes

5. **Request Completion**
   - Handler marks request as complete or rejected
   - Final status is recorded with appropriate comments
   - User is notified of request outcome

### 3.2 Security Implementation Details

1. **Password Management**
   - Passwords are hashed using bcrypt
   - Password history prevents reuse of recent passwords
   - Password expiration enforces regular updates

2. **Session Management**
   - Session-based authentication with secure storage
   - User context maintained for audit purposes
   - Automatic session timeout for security

3. **Error Handling**
   - Sensitive error details are logged but not exposed to clients
   - Consistent error response format
   - Proper transaction rollback on errors

## 4. Technical Considerations

### 4.1 Scalability

- Caching strategy allows for increased performance under load
- Database indexes optimize query performance
- Service-specific tables prevent the main table from growing too large

### 4.2 Maintainability

- Modular code organization by service type
- Consistent naming conventions across database and code
- Comprehensive logging for troubleshooting

### 4.3 Security

- Role-based access control
- Audit logging of all significant actions
- Secure password management
- Transaction-level data integrity

### 4.4 Future Enhancements

- API rate limiting for additional security
- Enhanced reporting capabilities
- Additional service types as needed
- Mobile application integration

## 5. Conclusion

The Security Service System provides a robust, secure platform for managing telecom security service requests. Its modular design allows for easy extension with new service types, while the comprehensive security features ensure proper access control and audit capabilities.

The system's architecture balances performance, security, and maintainability, making it suitable for enterprise-level deployment in a telecommunications environment.
