High-Level Design (HLD) of the Login System

Login System Flow

User Authentication:

User enters username and password
System validates credentials against database
On success, JWT token is generated and returned


Authentication States:

Normal Login: Direct access to dashboard
Temporary Password: Force password change before access
Failed Login: Error feedback with remaining attempts
Locked Account: Account locked after maximum attempts


Password Management:

Temporary Passwords: For new users or password resets
Password Change: Required for temporary passwords
Password Validation: Strength checking with visual feedback
Password Encryption: Secure hashing with bcrypt


Session Management:

JWT Token: Secure authentication with expiration
Activity Tracking: Prevents premature timeouts
Auto-Logout: After session timeout period
Account Inactivity: Auto-deactivation after 30 days


User Feedback:

Toast Notifications: For login status and errors
Visual Indicators: Password strength meter
Error Messages: Clear feedback for issues
Success Confirmation: For password changes
